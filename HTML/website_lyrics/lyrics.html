                I'm tired of being what you want me to be
                Feeling so faithless, lost under the surface
                I don't know what you're expecting of me
                Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes

                Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
                Every step that I take is another mistake to you
                Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
                I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
                Become so tired, so much more aware
                I'm becoming this, all I want to do
                Is be more like me and be less like you

                Can't you see that you're smothering me?
                Holding too tightly, afraid to lose control
                'Cause everything that you thought I would be
                Has fallen apart, right in front of you

                Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
                Every step that I take is another mistake to you
                Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
                And every second I waste is more than I can take
                I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
                Become so tired, so much more aware
                I'm becoming this, all I want to do
                Is be more like me and be less like you

                And I know
                I may end up failing too
                But I know
                You were just like me with someone disappointed in you
                I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
                Become so tired, so much more aware
                I'm becoming this, all I want to do
                Is be more like me and be less like you

                I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
                I'm tired of being what you want me to be
                I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
                I'm tired of being what you want me to be
