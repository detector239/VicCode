﻿Association football, more commonly known as football or soccer,[a]
is a team sport played between two teams of 11 players each, who primarily use
their feet to propel a ball around a rectangular field called a pitch. The
objective of the game is to score more goals than the opposing team by moving
the ball beyond the goal line into a rectangular-framed goal defended by the
opposing team. Traditionally, the game has been played over two 45-minute halves,
for a total match time of 90 minutes. With an estimated 250 million players active
in over 200 countries and territories, it is the world's most popular sport.
